# image-splitter-rect
This program takes a photo and crops it in subimages.

it needs more work to do. if the height and width of the subimage arent divisible for the height and width of the photo to crop it throws an exception.
it works with png and jpg files. i havent tested other types. it could be nice to add the option to decide the number of subimages you want instead of the dimensions of them.
i will update it. feel free to update it. contact me if u need anything.
